 * The progress of cross region bucket replication.

 * For historical data, it uses the percentage (e.g. 0.85 means 85%) of copied
 * file count as the progress indicator. It's only applicable for buckets
 * enabled with historical data replication. For new coming data, it uses the
 * replicated timestamp as the progress indicator. It means all files which are
 * uploaded before that timestamp have been replicated to the target bucket.
